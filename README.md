# Web Scraping product with beautiful soup

## Introduction

In this project, a Python script has been developed to perform web scraping on a website containing information about whisky products. The purpose of this script is to extract product data from multiple pages of the website and organize it into a data structure that can be further processed. This process involves the use of libraries such as requests for sending HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML, pandas for data manipulation, and tqdm for providing a progress bar visualization.
